        <p>My name is Emma and I have been fortunate to channel my passion for dogs into a successful dog walking business.  I have been a dog walker for over 8 years in Harrow and I am fully insured.  My clients feel that I am trustworthy and reliable.</p>
        <p>As the title suggests, I walk dogs with love and care and their well-being is my priority.  My hours are flexible to suit the busy lives of most people.  I take dogs to local parks and give them the opportunity to play games and explore.</p>
        <p>You can be assured of peace of mind that while you are out, your dog is being looked after and that the will be returned to you happy and healthy.</p>
